#test1.fcasm
#designed to be close to real asm

#registers:
# [ABCD]B - Registers with the size of 1 byte
# [ABCD]S - Registers with the size of 1 short/word
# [ABCD]L - Registers with the size of 1 long word/short
# PC - location of current instruction
# IR - current instruction (not entirely useful for programming with, as you would already know what instruction you are using, but ill add another instruction register for interrupts later)
# SP - stack pointer/loactionof the stack - not a whole lot of use yet im afraid...
# CSP - curent stack position relative to SP
# JP - jump pointer/where to jump if a J*** comparison is called
